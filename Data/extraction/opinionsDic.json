He advised me to call back another time because no one else with any authority could help me. When I asked for his name, employee number, or reference number for my complaint, he told me his name was “John” and could not provide any further information to track my complaint.

By implementing rigid policies that block sharing accounts across households, Netflix has alienated loyal customers who have long relied on their service to connect with family and friends. The move reeks of corporate greed, with no meaningful justification beyond boosting profits at the expense of customer goodwill.What makes this change even more egregious is the lack of any notable improvement in the platform’s content quality. If Netflix were using this policy shift to fund groundbreaking original programming or significantly enhance its user experience, there might be some small shred of justification. Instead, the platform continues to churn out uninspired, forgettable series and movies that don’t come close to justifying its inflated subscription prices.Netflix seems oblivious to the fact that the streaming market is more competitive than ever. Services like Hulu, HBO Max, and Disney+ are offering superior content and features without resorting to such desperate tactics. By penalizing users for account sharing—a practice they once encouraged—Netflix risks driving subscribers to its competitors, who appear far more in tune with customer expectations.The attempt to squeeze every last penny from subscribers while delivering the same underwhelming library shows how disconnected Netflix has become from the people who built its success. It’s a short-sighted decision that damages trust, alienates customers, and reveals a company more focused on quarterly profits than long-term value.For a company that built its reputation on innovation and customer-centric policies, this is nothing short of a betrayal.

", 'Rate': 'Rated 1 out of 5 stars'}, {'Content': "As a long-term subscriber, I expected Netflix to maintain transparent and user-friendly practices for account and billing management. Unfortunately, recent experiences have proven otherwise, especially regarding changes to the billing cycle and the lack of clear guidance.Firstly, Netflix fails to clearly communicate the effects that changes to your account can have on the billing cycle. Adjustments to plans or billing settings seem straightforward but can lead to unexpected surprises with billing dates and charges. There’s no advance warning about how seemingly minor adjustments might impact your billing schedule, which is a basic aspect of customer transparency.Moreover, Netflix's inflexibility around billing dates is deeply inconvenient. Once an adjustment has been made, you’re effectively stuck with the new billing date—even if it doesn’t suit your schedule. A simple request to revert to the original date or select a preferred billing cycle cannot be accommodated, as Netflix lacks any option to adjust billing cycles once they’re set.The only workaround is to cancel your subscription entirely and rejoin on a date that aligns with your preferred billing schedule. This, however, is a frustrating solution with a major downside: you lose your profile’s watch history, preferences, and recommendations. For those who’ve built up years of personalised content, this is an enormous drawback that Netflix doesn’t adequately address. It’s a surprising oversight for a company that prides itself on understanding user data.Overall, Netflix could improve in both clarity and flexibility.

It\'s a week into this "non-existent" new plan and I have not been offered a refund, neither can I even find a link to how to request one, but now I am supposed to go pay $15.49 to switch to an ad-free plan, or cancel and wait until the next billing cycle (23 days) to watch Netflix again under a plan supported in the country where I\'ve lived all my life and been a Netflix customer for 9 years?

I was shocked and appalled and cancelled immediately which they seem quite pleased about. So they have lied to customers as there was never any mention when they changed our plan that actually we might need a new tv and they lie again advising on their help screen that they are working on the problem and to call customer services which is surely interpreted by normal people that it will soon be fixed and is their problem not ours because when you call them you are told the solution is you pay £6 per month more or buy a new tv. Surely having offered the cheaper plan they should have made sure it worked for all their customers. Appalling behaviour and certainly not in line with fair trading surely.

Also that I/we had had an email saying we had chosen a new service with advertisements. I TOLD HIM "NO WE HAD NOT CHOSEN TO HAVE ADVERTISEMENTS"!I said we just want to have the service and viewing facilities we had got used to over the last 7/8 years. It took me many attempts, with this brick-wall guy, to establish that they were still charging us £7.99 per month and that now we were NOT getting ANY NETFLIX at all!!He said that to keep what we used to get we would have to pay £10.99!I said why didn\'t you send us an email saying so!! HE HAD NO ANSWER!It\'s clear to me that NF were/are trying to take money from their customers through deciept and techno gobledegooge confusion.I told them can stick their rip-off facility up their proverbial collective arses! My view is in short: that they really deserve to go bust. Not just because of their increased charges but for the way they are treating their customers.We have now contacted our credit card company and and asked them to retrieve the recent charges as the service we agreed to was not being provided. The bank has agreed & indeed has now done that. I suggest others do the same because this company has become scammy and unscrupulous. We as a family do not wish to be treat in this despicable way!NETFLIX IS NOW AN OVERPRICED DECEITFUL COMPANY!!PRIME IS PROBABLY OVERJOYED WITH NETFLIXES DECAY INTO BEING A SCUMMY, UNTRUSTRUSTWORTHY, PARASITIC ENTERPRISE.They are are not getting any more of our money and we will warn others to avoid their overpriced, underhand methods.', 'Rate': 'Rated 1 out of 5 stars'}, {'Content': 'Charging to watch tv with adverts is a ridiculously greedy plan, if I am paying for a service, I don’t expect adverts.

Several factors have made me cancel and l may never renew again. Their card payment system, if you do not have the money one day, before they would retry a day or two later and get their payment.People have major bills to pay and sometimes these  minor subscriptions like Netflix have to wait. Recently though they tried my account on 3 occasions in just over 24 hours which is unacceptable. While you can eventually get through on the phone many "online" companies try to hide their phone number, make contacting them a digital nightmare with Chatbots. This needs to stop. Companies like Netflix need to be easily contacted instead if this game they play.Also this invasion of privacy, l understand that all streaming services can see what you\'re watching but you really should be able to opt out. I don\'t want to tell them whether l liked a film or not, it\'s not their business. The multiple attempts at taking money though is my main concern. As many have said here, is their complaints process fit for purpose or do l need to escalate this outside. Tech companies and streaming services need not think they can bamboozle people and they will give up. They are accountable just like every other company. You really should have a choice to go with direct debits as often Netflix takes money out at all hours of the day and night,often weekends and at strange unsociable hours, not really good business.
